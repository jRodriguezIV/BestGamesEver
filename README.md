# BestGamesEver

Welcome to BestGamesEver! ðŸ˜ƒ

This React.js front-end application utilizes an Express.js back-end with SQL to retrieve and display information 
about a curated selection of some of the best games ever made. The application makes API calls to the back-end to 
fetch the necessary data and presents it in an intuitive user interface built with React.js. The goal is to provide
users with access to detailed information about these games, allowing them to explore and discover new gaming experiences.
